Just for learning git stuff like branching and all.

This story starts here. Before any forks or branches. There was a boy named Peter Parker and a girl named Mary Jane. They studied in the same class. He was completely lost in his code and she was lost in her thoughts of quarterback Harry. Mary Jane was a fine girl as there could be and Peter was hardly desirable for Mary. Peter knew he didn't have a chance with the Mary. So he decided to code all day trying to come up with some way to bring out the dark shades of Harry. Of course harry knew shits about computers and so he was dumb enough to let Peter do all the dirty things to him.
